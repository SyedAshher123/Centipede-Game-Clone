# Centipede-Game-Clone
Description:


The Centipede Game Clone is a simplified version of the classic Atari game, Centipede, created using C++ and the SFML library. This project focuses on basic C++ concepts and avoids advanced features such as classes and objects. It serves as an excellent example of how simple programming techniques can be used to create engaging games.

Features:

1. Classic Gameplay: Shoot the descending centipede before it reaches the bottom.
2. Basic C++ Concepts: Uses fundamental programming concepts without classes and objects.
3. Keyboard Controls:
   
     Arrow Keys: Move the player.
   
     Space Bar: Shoot bullets.

5. Multiple Levels: Progress through levels by killing the entire centipede.
6. Interactive Environment:
   
     Mushrooms: Affect the movement of the centipede and can be destroyed.

     Poisonous Mushrooms: Appear when centipede segments are killed in the player region, causing game over if collided with.

Technologies Used:

 Programming Language: C++

 Library: SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)

Prerequisites:

1. Install GNU G++ Compiler: sudo apt-get install g++
2. Install SFML: sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

Steps to Run:

1. Download complete folder contaning cpp file, music, textures, sound effects or clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd centipede-game-clone
3. Compile the code:
   
     g++ -c Centipede.cpp

     g++ Centipede.o -o sfml-app -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-audio -lsfml-window -lsfml-system

4. Run the game:
./sfml-app

Usage:

Start the Game: Run the compiled program to start playing.

Move the Player: Use the arrow keys to move the player left, right, up, and down.

Shoot Bullets: Press the space bar to shoot bullets at the descending centipede.

Avoid Collisions: Do not let the centipede or poisonous mushrooms collide with the player.
